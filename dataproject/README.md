# Data analysis project

**The future Corona cases in Denmark**       
We first give an overview of the sitaution in Denmark; graphing the Corona cases, deaths, recovered, death rate and recovered rate then, we model we use a simple exponential growth model to extrapolate the future Corona cases in Denmark.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades the datasets**: **covid_19_data.xlsx**   

We use data from John Hopkins University originating from Statens Serum Institut. 

The data can be downloaded from this Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset#covid_19_data.csv 
We have converted the csv-file to a xlsx-file before uploading it to our repository. 

The methods used to estimate the underreported cases are inspired by the website:
